Do you see a relationship between the allowed range, the size of the quads, the amount of compression, 
and the resulting image quality?

There is a relation amongst them all.

As range increases, the size of the quads increase (we're allowing a greater 
range inside each quad), the amount of compression increases (bigger quads =>
smaller number of total quads => less memory used), and the resulting image 
quality decreases (whole idea of compression).
